## Hi there!

I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Experimental Psychology at Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/pp/experimentele-psychologie/en). My research mostly focuses on language comprehension. Within this broad topic, I am mostly interested in semantics: How do we derive meaning from a sentence, and how do we represent these meanings? I am also interested in the semantics-syntax and semantics-pragmatics interfaces, language acquisition, and bilingual language processing.

More specifically, my PhD research mostly focuses on the representation of semantically ambiguous sentences that involve multiple quantifiers. Take the sentence _Every man bit a dog_. Does this sentence refer to a situation in which all men bit one and the same (poor) dog or to a situation in which each man bit a different dog? I want to know which processes are involved in interpreting such sentences and how we represent these interpretations. I study these questions by condicting psycholinguistic experiments, which involve the structural priming paradigm or visual world eye-tracking. 

My PhD research is funded by the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO). Before coming to Ghent, I earned my master's degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge (UK) and my bachelor's degree in Dutch Language and Culture (specialisation in Linguistics) at the University of Groningen (NL).
